- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an intricate neurodevelopmental condition that significantly impacts socialization and is distinguished by atypical, limited, or repetitive language behaviors. Our research focuses on the diagnosis of ASD utilizing multi-modal brain image data in conjunction with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically incorporating Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI), and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Additionally, our objective is to identify the pathogenic functional regions within the brain networks associated with ASD.
